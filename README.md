# NgTransform

## Goal

Mostly for fun and gettng exposure to developing with the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) AST tooling for creating transforms and collecting metadata about [Angular](https://angular.io) projects.

## Why?

Augment build time strategy with run-time component library strategy using Angular Elements.

## Setup

```
$ npm i
```

## Building command-line tools

```
$ npm run build
```

## Seeing a list of all of the available commands

```
npm run cli --help
```

## Executing command-line tools

```
$ npm run cli <command> <arguments>
```

## A note about directories

mocks/ Contains sample Angular files used to testing CLI.
stubs/ Contains base Angular files used for generating code.

## Useful tools for development
